## Labor Productivity Analysis


---

### Project description

The project idea is based on a CNN news article regarding working hours in South Korea (https://edition.cnn.com/2018/07/02/health/south-korea-work-hours/index.html). It sais that South Korea cutted its work limit from 68 hours a week to 52. A comparison of "Average annual hours actually worked per worker" by country (https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=ANHRS#) shows that in 2021 South Korea had the 4th highest amount of hours of 35 countries tracked by OECD. The average was 1.915 hours where Germany worked the least with 1.349 hours.
South Korea and Germany are both known for strong economies but obviously behave different regarding working hours. Due to this fact the project group (herein, "we") decided to investigate the subject of labor productivity. Productivity is commonly defined as a ratio between the volume of output and the volume of inputs. In other words, it measures how efficiently production inputs, such as labour, is used in an economy to produce a given level of output. Hence it is a key source for economic growth and affects our future worklife.
